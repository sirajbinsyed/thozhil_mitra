# thozhil_mitra
The Thozhil Mitra project is a Python Flask application with a MySQL database, designed to digitalize and streamline the management of Kudumbashree work activities. This platform is aimed at enhancing the operational efficiency of Kudumbashree by organizing and tracking various work-related tasks and roles.

The project consists of three key modules:

1) Landowner/Worker Module: Landowners and workers can use this module to post work requirements, view available opportunities, and manage assignments. Workers can also track 
   their tasks and payments, ensuring a transparent workflow for all involved.

2) Mate Module: The Mate serves as a coordinator, managing work assignments, overseeing the attendance and performance of workers, and ensuring that each project progresses 
   smoothly. They can assign tasks, track daily activities, and communicate updates to both workers and landowners, supporting organized and efficient task management.

3) Admin Module: Administrators oversee the entire platform, managing users, updating project information, and monitoring activities across the system. They ensure that the 
   operations are aligned with Kudumbashreeâ€™s goals, providing support and maintaining data integrity across the application.
